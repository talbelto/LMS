// Class Name:LibraryManagementSystem

// Overall Class Description:
// This program represents a library management system. It contains a main method
// that provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the library. The class utilizes the
// `Library` class to perform various library operations like adding books, removing books, listing the entire
// book collection, and exiting the system.

//The main method of this class initializes an instance of the `Library` class and loads books from a file.
// It then prompts the user to select an option from the menu, reads their input using a `Scanner`,
// and executes the corresponding action based on the selected option.The class handles user input using
// a switch statement, and based on the user's choice. It performs the required actions by calling
// appropriate methods from the `Library` class.

//The options provided in the menu are as follows:
//1. Add a new book: This option prompts the user to input a book ID, title, and author, and adds the book
// to the library's collection.
//2. Remove a book: This option prompts the user to input a book ID and removes the corresponding book
// from the library's collection.
//3. List all book collections: This option displays all the books currently stored in the library's collection.
//4. End Session: This option exits the library management system.
