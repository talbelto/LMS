//Program Objective: The main objective of the program is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing a library.
// Users can perform various actions like adding books, removing books, checking out and checking in books, and
// viewing the library's database.

// Class Name:LibraryManagementSystem
//Summary:This class serves as the main entry point of the program. It contains a loop that displays a menu for various library
// operations and takes user input to perform those operations.

// Class Description:
// This program represents a library management system. It contains a main method
// that provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the library. The class utilizes the
// `Library` class to perform various library operations like adding books, removing books, listing the entire
// book collection, checking in /checking out books and exiting the system.

//The main method of this class initializes an instance of the `Library` class and loads books from a file.
// It then prompts the user to select an option from the menu, reads their input using a `Scanner`,
// and executes the corresponding action based on the selected option.The class handles user input using
// a switch statement, and based on the user's choice. It performs the required actions by calling
// appropriate methods from the `Library` class.

//The options provided in the menu are as follows:
//1. Add books from a file to the library database
//2. Add book to database Manually
//3. Print the database
//4. Remove book from database using a barcode number
//5. Remove book from database using book title
//6. Check out a book from library database
//7. Check in a book from library database
//8. Exit Database
