// Class Name:Library
//Summary:This class represents the library itself. It contains methods to load books from a file, display the books in
//the database, remove a book by barcode or title, check out a book, and check in a book. It maintains a collection of
// books and performs operations on them.


// Class Description:
//This class represents a library that contains a collection of books. It implements the `Serializable`
// interface, indicating that objects of this class can be serialized and deserialized.The `Library` class
// has one private instance variable: `books`, which is a list of `Book` objects. It provides methods
// to add a book to the library, remove a book from the library by barcode, list all books in the library,
// load books from a file and Check in and Check out books. The `Library` class primarily focuses on managing the collection of `Book`objects
// and providing functionality to add, remove, list, and load books in the library.

    ////Purpose: Initializes a `Library` object by creating a new ArrayList to store the books.
    ////Arguments: None
    ////Return Value: None

    //`addBook` method: Adds a book to the library manually.
    //Method: `addBook(Book book)`
    //Purpose: Adds a book to the library by adding it to the `books` list.

    //Method to remove a book from the library based on its title
    // Method: removeBook
